Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection

Benefits:
Machine learning can process large amounts of data quickly, identify patterns humans might miss, and make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention.

Challenges:
- Data quality issues
- Overfitting
- Interpretability
- Ethical considerations
